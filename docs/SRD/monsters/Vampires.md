Multiattack (Vampire Form Only). The vampire makes two Grave Strike attacks and uses Bite.

Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only). Constitution Saving Throw: DC 17, one creature within 5 feet that is willing or that has the Grappled, Incapacitated, or Restrained condition. Failure: 6 (1d4 + 4) Piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) Necrotic damage. The target's Hit Point maximum

decreases by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains Hit Points equal to that amount. A Humanoid reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage and then buried rises the following sunset as a Vampire Spawn under the vampire's control.

### Bonus Actions

Charm (Recharge 5-6). The vampire casts Charm Person, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17), and the duration is 24 hours. The Charmed target is a willing recipient of the vampire's Bite, the damage of which doesn't end the spell. When the spell ends, the target is unaware it was Charmed by the vampire.

Shape-Shift. If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it shape-shifts into a Tiny bat (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 30 ft.) or a Medium cloud of mist (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 20 ft. [hover]), or it returns to its vampire form. Anything it is wearing transforms with it.

While in bat form, the vampire can't speak. Its game statistics, other than its size and Speed, are unchanged.

While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless and can enter an enemy's space and stop there. If air can pass through a space, the mist can do so, but it can't pass through liquid. It has Resistance to all damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

###  Legendary Actions

Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after another creature's turn, the vampire can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The vampire regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

Beguile. The vampire casts Command, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17). The vampire can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

Deathless Strike. The vampire moves up to half its Speed, and it makes one Grave Strike attack.
