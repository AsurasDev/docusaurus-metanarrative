### Traits

Iron Scent. The rust monster can pinpoint the location of ferrous metal within 30 feet of itself.

### Actions

Multiattack. The rust monster makes one Bite attack and uses Antennae twice.

Bite. Melee Attack Roll: +3, reach 5 ft. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) Piercing damage.

Antennae. The rust monster targets one nonmagical metal object—armor or a weapon—worn or carried by a creature within 5 feet of itself. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 11, the creature with the object. Failure: The object takes a  $-1$  penalty to the AC it offers (armor) or to its attack rolls (weapon). Armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10, and a weapon is destroyed if its penalty reaches  $-5$ . The penalty can be removed by casting the Mending spell on the armor or weapon.

Destroy Metal. The rust monster touches a nonmagical metal object within 5 feet of itself that isn't being worn or carried. The touch destroys a 1-foot Cube of the object.

### Reactions

Reflexive Antennae. Trigger: An attack roll hits the rust monster. Response: The rust monster uses Antennae.
