Necrotic Bow. Ranged Attack Roll: +4, range 150/600 ft. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) Piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) Necrotic damage.

Life Drain. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 13, one creature within 5 feet. Failure: 6 (1d8 + 2) Necrotic damage, and the target's Hit Point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the damage taken.
