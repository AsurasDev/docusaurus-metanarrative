### Traits

Demonic Restoration. If the vrock dies outside the Abyss, its body dissolves into ichor, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its Hit Points somewhere in the Abyss.

Magic Resistance. The vrock has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

Multiattack. The vrock makes two Shred attacks.

Shred. Melee Attack Roll: +6, reach 5 ft. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) Piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Poison damage.

Spores (Recharge 6). Constitution Saving Throw: DC 15, each creature in a 20-foot Emanation originating from the vrock. Failure: The target has the Poisoned condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. While Poisoned, the target takes 5 (1d10) Poison damage at the start of each of its turns. Emptying a flask of Holy Water on the target ends the effect early.

Stunning Screech (1/Day). Constitution Saving Throw: DC 15, each creature in a 20-foot Emanation originating from the vrock (demons succeed automatically). Failure: 10 (3d6) Thunder damage, and the target has the Stunned condition until the end of the vrock's next turn.
