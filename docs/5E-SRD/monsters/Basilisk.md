Petrifying Gaze (Recharge 4-6). Constitution Saving Throw: DC 12, each creature in a 30-foot Cone. If the basilisk sees its reflection in the Cone, the basilisk must make this save. First Failure: The target has the Restrained condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still Restrained, ending the effect on itself on a success. Second Failure: The target has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition.
