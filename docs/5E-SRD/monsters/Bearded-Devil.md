### Traits

Magic Resistance. The devil has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

Multiattack. The devil makes one Beard attack and one Infernal Glaive attack.

Beard. Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 5 ft. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) Piercing damage, and the target has the Poisoned condition until the start of the devil's next turn. Until this poison ends, the target can't regain Hit Points.

Infernal Glaive. Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 10 ft. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) Slashing damage. If the target is a creature and doesn't already have an infernal wound, it is subjected to the following effect. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 12. Failure: The target receives an infernal wound. While wounded, the target loses 5 (1d10) Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. The wound closes after 1 minute, after a spell restores Hit Points to the target, or after the target or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to stanch the wound, doing so by succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
