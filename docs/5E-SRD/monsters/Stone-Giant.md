Multiattack. The giant makes two attacks, using Stone Club or Boulder in any combination.

Stone Club. Melee Attack Roll: +9, reach 15 ft. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) Bludgeoning damage.

Boulder. Ranged Attack Roll: +9, range 60/240 ft. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the Prone condition.

### Reactions

Response: The giant reduces the damage it takes from the attack by 11 (1d10 + 6), and if that damage is reduced to 0, the giant can redirect some of the attack's force. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 17, one creature the giant can see within 60 feet. Failure: 11 (1d10 + 6) Force damage.
